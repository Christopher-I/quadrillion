---

## CLIENT PREFERENCES & CONSTRAINTS

### Quality Over Quantity
- "Rather sacrifice pages for quality"
- Wants ~10 well-crafted pages vs. 20 mediocre ones

### Technical Comfort
- George has Webflow experience from previous sites
- Comfortable with CMS, can manage updates independently
- Data architect/software developer background

### Budget Consciousness
- Starting lean, will prove model before expanding
- Cost matters - negotiated from $8,500 to $7,500

### Aesthetic Requirements
- NOT flashy
- Modern but serious
- Professional and credible
- Appropriate for semiconductors/manufacturing (not consumer-facing)

---

## COMPETITIVE CONTEXT

### Industry Challenge
"PE sites in our industry are really bad" - George

### Differentiation Opportunity
- Most PE sites are dated, generic, template-heavy
- SCC wants modern, professional, industry-specific
- Opportunity to stand out with quality execution

---

## CHRISTOPHER'S PROPOSAL RATIONALE

### Why Webflow Was Recommended
1. **Speed**: 3-week timeline achievable
2. **George's Familiarity**: Already knows the platform
3. **Quality**: Can achieve "Institutional Industrial" aesthetic
4. **CMS Independence**: George can manage updates himself
5. **Cost-Effective**: At $7,500, good balance of speed and quality

### Why NOT Squarespace
- More expensive ($10,500)
- Less capable
- Requires more custom code workarounds
- Harder to achieve desired aesthetic

### Custom Option (Not Chosen)
- Would have been $7,500, 4 weeks
- Best long-term value, full ownership
- But needed 1 extra week (couldn't accommodate)

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Week 1, Days 1-2)
1. Christopher sends invoice for 50% deposit ($3,750)
2. George shares Dropbox link with brand assets
3. Schedule kickoff call (60 minutes)
4. Christopher presents 3-4 Webflow templates for selection

### Kickoff Call Agenda
- Review brand assets from Dropbox
- Discuss semiconductor company logos for banner
- Clarify messaging priorities (investor vs. management)
- Show template options
- Outline content delivery timeline
- Answer questions

### Communication
- **Primary**: Upwork messaging or Slack
- **Calls**: 2-3 throughout project (scheduled in advance)
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours (same-day for urgent)

---

## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Timeline Discipline**: Must launch in 3 weeks for board proposal
2. **Dual Audience Balance**: Serve both investors (75%) and management teams (25%)
3. **SEC Compliance**: Language must be compliant but effective
4. **Credibility First**: Every design choice reinforces institutional trust
5. **Quality Execution**: Professional, modern, not flashy
6. **CMS Readiness**: Structure for future portfolio company additions

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS / DECISIONS NEEDED

- [ ] Which Webflow template? (Christopher to present options)
- [ ] Exact page titles and navigation structure?
- [ ] Domain name registered or needs to be?
- [ ] Pond5 video selection (Christopher can send examples)
- [ ] Advisory Board members finalized?
- [ ] Legal counsel review of CTA language?

---

## PROJECT RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk: Timeline Pressure (3 weeks)
**Mitigation**: Template-based approach, George's Webflow familiarity, clear milestones

### Risk: Content Delays
**Mitigation**: Early content checklist, George's writing background, structured delivery schedule

### Risk: SEC Compliance Issues
**Mitigation**: Conservative language, legal counsel review before launch

### Risk: $400M Deal Timing
**Mitigation**: Hard deadline communicated, weekly check-ins, buffer built into Week 3
