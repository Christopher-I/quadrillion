# Silicon Century Capital — Website Kickoff & Template Review

**Call Agenda (60 min)**

---

## 1) Context Setting (5 min)
**Goal: Lock in the hard constraints**

- **What's the exact date you're sending the board letter?**
  - Work backward from there to confirm launch date
  - Week 3 (Nov 25) or Week 4 (Dec 2)?

- **Which 3-4 pages MUST be perfect for board review?**
  - vs. which can launch "good enough" and polish later

---

## 2) Template Decision (25 min)
**Goal: Pick today, confirm tomorrow, start building Wednesday**

### Top 4 Templates

| Template | Price | Pages | Fit | Speed | Preview |
|----------|-------|-------|-----|-------|---------|
| **Investor X** | $79 | 15 | ⭐9/10 | Fast | [Preview](https://investortemplate.webflow.io) |
| **Foresight** | $129 | Multi | ⭐9/10 | Medium | [Preview](https://foresight-template.webflow.io) |
| **Ventcapital** | $49 | Multi | ⭐8.5/10 | Fastest | [Preview](https://ventcapital-investment.webflow.io) |
| **Capital** | $129 | 25+ | ⭐8/10 | Medium | [Preview](https://capitaltemplate.webflow.io) |

**Fit Score** = institutional industrial aesthetic + investor credibility + speed to launch

### Recommendation
- **Best overall**: Investor X
- **Best aesthetic**: Foresight
- **Fastest**: Ventcapital
- **Most comprehensive**: Capital

### Decision Process
1. Review live demos now
2. Pick your favorite today
3. I'll send preview link tonight for you to review
4. Confirm final choice by Wed morning
5. **Start building Wednesday**

**Question**: Are you comfortable with 70-80% template + 20-30% customization approach? (Full custom would push to Week 4)

---

## 3) Page Structure Alignment (10 min)
**Goal: Confirm we're building the right thing**

Based on our first conversation, here's the structure I'm planning:

### Must-Have Pages
1. **Home** - Hero with video background, dual CTAs
2. **About / Strategy** - Investment approach, "why SCC"
3. **Investment Focus** - The "New Industrial Core" positioning
4. **Industries** - Semiconductors, Robotics, Advanced Manufacturing
5. **Team** - Leadership bios + headshots
6. **Advisory Board** - Separate section (if finalized)
7. **Portfolio** - Structure ready for future companies
8. **Contact** - Dual forms (investor inquiry + transaction inquiry)
9. **Privacy Policy**
10. **Terms of Use**

### Post-Launch (Optional)
- **News / Insights** - Can add later if needed
- **Fact Sheet** - I noticed all competitor sites have downloadable one-pagers. Worth considering for post-launch refinement, but not critical for Week 3.

**Key Question**: Which pages MUST be 100% perfect for the board to see? Which can be "Version 1.0" and refined after the letter goes out?

---

## 4) What You Already Have vs. What We Need (10 min)
**Goal: Avoid reinventing the wheel**

### You Already Have
- ✅ Brand guide (colors, typography, visual direction)
- ✅ Narrative design brief
- ✅ Implementation guide
- ✅ Business narrative document
- ✅ Logos & brand assets (Dropbox)
- ✅ Semiconductor company logos

**Question**: Can you share the Dropbox link on this call so I can access everything?

### What I Need From You (Raw Notes Are Fine)

**WEEK 1 PRIORITIES** (needed by Fri, Nov 8):
- Homepage headline + 2-3 paragraph company description
- Team bios (1 paragraph each) + headshots
- Semiconductor company logos you want on banner
  - **Question**: Any legal restrictions on which logos we can use?

**WEEK 2 PRIORITIES** (needed by Mon, Nov 11):
- About page narrative (can pull from business narrative doc)
- Investment criteria details
- Industries page content
- Advisory Board info (if ready to publish)
  - **Question**: Is Advisory Board finalized?

**NO POLISHING NEEDED** - Send me bullet points and raw text. I'll refine into institutional language that matches your brand guide tone.

---

## 5) Critical Technical Questions (5 min)

### Domain
- What domain do you want to use?
- Is it already registered?
- Who has access to domain settings?
- **Important**: Domain setup takes 24-48 hours. Need to start this by Week 3 at latest.

### Video Background
- **Pond5 footage** for hero section
- Should I send you 3-4 options to choose from?
- **Backup plan**: Launch with high-quality static image, add video in polish phase?

### Legal Review
- Do you need attorney to review investor CTA language before launch?
  - "Learn More About SCC" vs. "Become an Investment Partner"
  - Privacy Policy / Terms of Use
- **If yes**: When can they review? (Adds 2-5 days to timeline)
- **If no**: I'll use industry-standard SEC-compliant language

---

## 6) Launch Timeline (5 min)

### Working Backward From Your Board Letter

**Target Launch**: Week 3 (Nov 25)
**Backup Launch**: Week 4 (Dec 2)

| Week | Milestone | Deliverables |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Week 1** (Nov 4-8) | Template selection + foundation | Template picked (by Wed), brand assets shared, domain access secured |
| **Week 2** (Nov 11-15) | Development + content | Build homepage, key pages, integrate content as you send it |
| **Week 3** (Nov 18-22) | Review + polish + launch | Final content, QA, video, launch by Nov 25 |
| **Week 4** (Nov 25-29) | Backup window | If content delayed, launch Dec 2 |

### Project Management Approach: Crawl, Walk, Run

**Right now we're in CRAWL phase:**
- Quick communication (text, email, quick calls)
- Focus on velocity and decisions
- No overhead tools yet

**End of Week 3, we enter RUN phase:**
- Once site is live and we're in refinement mode
- Bring in **Asana** for tracking specific changes
- By then we can easily quantify what needs adjustment
- Clear task lists for polish items

**Why wait on Asana?** Right now we need to move fast and make big decisions. Asana shines when we're tracking 20 specific tweaks (copy changes, image swaps, layout adjustments). That's the polish phase, not the build phase.

## 7) Competitive Landscape Context

Based on research into industrial PE firms in your space:

**Firms in similar territory:**
- American Industrial Partners (AIP)
- CORE Industrial Partners
- Monomoy Capital Partners

**What they emphasize:**
- Sector thesis + niche focus
- Industrial credibility tone (serious, not flashy)
- Team expertise in industrial ecosystems
- Track record signals (even high-level)
- Case studies / portfolio overview

**What many have (post-launch consideration):**
- **Fact sheet / deal sheet** - One-page downloadable PDF with strategy summary, target sectors, contact info
- I noticed this on every competitor site
- **Recommendation**: Deprioritize for Week 3 launch. Add during polish phase if board feedback indicates it would be valuable.

**Our approach**: Mirror the professionalism without over-inflation. Serious, credible, technical, investor-facing.
