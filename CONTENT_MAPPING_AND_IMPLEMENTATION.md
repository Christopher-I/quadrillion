## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (TODAY/TOMORROW)

### 1. Email George - Request Missing Assets
**Subject**: "SCC Website - Quick Asset Request + Questions"

**Body**:
```
Hi George,

Great progress! I have the Foresight template set up and I'm integrating your copy now (excellent work, by the way - really strong messaging).

To keep us on track for Week 3 launch, I need a few items from you:

URGENT (Week 1):
1. Your professional headshot (high resolution, for Team page)
2. Dropbox link with brand assets you mentioned
3. Semiconductor company logos for homepage banner (+ confirm any usage restrictions)

CLARIFICATIONS:
4. Email routing: Should I route all contact forms to ContactUs@siliconcenturycapital.com, or do investors@ and deals@ exist as separate addresses?
5. Domain preference: Use siliconcentury.com as primary and forward siliconcenturycapital.com to it? Or vice versa?
6. Advisory Board: Is this ready to publish at launch, or post-launch addition?

WEEK 2 (No Rush):
7. Fact sheet/teaser PDF (for download button)
8. Founder video (I'll send recording guidelines if you want to tackle this)

I'm sourcing the hero video from Art List today and will send you 3-4 options to review by end of week.

Current timeline: On track for Nov 22-25 launch (Week 3). You'll see staging site with 50% of content by end of this week.

Let me know if you have questions!

Chris

## 📊 PROJECT HEALTH & RISKS

### Project Health: 🟢 EXCELLENT

**Reasons**:
- ✅ Template selected on Day 1 (ahead of schedule)
- ✅ Complete copy received by Day 3 (ahead of schedule)
- ✅ George is responsive and decisive
- ✅ Copy is professional, comprehensive, and ready to implement
- ✅ Brand guidelines clear
- ✅ No major scope changes (AI sector addition was minor)
- ✅ Timeline pressure reduced (presentation not until after Dec 1)

### Risks: 🟡 LOW-MEDIUM

#### Risk #1: Missing Assets (George's Headshot, Dropbox)
- **Impact**: Medium (can't complete Team page without headshot)
- **Likelihood**: Low (George has been responsive)
- **Mitigation**: Email today with clear list of needed items

#### Risk #2: Domain Access Timing
- **Impact**: Medium (DNS takes 24-48 hours)
- **Likelihood**: Low (George owns domains)
- **Mitigation**: Request access by end of Week 2 to allow time for propagation

#### Risk #3: Email Routing Confusion
- **Impact**: Low (can route everything to one email if needed)
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Clarify with George today

#### Risk #4: Video Quality (Founder Video)
- **Impact**: Low (nice-to-have, not critical for launch)
- **Likelihood**: Medium (recording quality varies)
- **Mitigation**: Not needed for launch, can add post-launch. Provide clear recording guidelines.

### Overall Risk Assessment: LOW ✅
