# Silicon Century Capital - Weekly Progress Report
**Week Ending:** November 10, 2025
**Prepared by:** Chris
**Project Status:** ✅ All Core Pages Complete

---

## Progress vs. Original Agreement

**Original Scope:** 10 pages, 3 weeks, $8,500

### Why 7 Pages Instead of 10?

**Original 10 Pages Proposed:**
1. ✅ Home
2. ✅ About / Our Approach
3. ✅ Investment Strategy / Sectors
4. ✅ Contact
5. ✅ Portfolio
6. ✅ Privacy Policy
7. ✅ Terms of Use
8. ❌ Team page
9. ❌ Advisory Board page
10. ❌ Industries We Serve (separate page)

**What Changed & Why:**

**Team Page → Consolidated into About Page**
- You're currently the only team member
- Creating a separate "Team" page with just one person looks incomplete and raises questions
- Your bio, photo, and background are prominently featured in the "Meet Our Founder" section on the About page
- This is more professional than a sparse team page
- When you add team members in the future, we can create a dedicated Team page

**Advisory Board Page → Not Built**
- You don't have an advisory board yet
- Building an empty page would look unprofessional
- When you form an advisory board, we can add this page easily

**Industries We Serve → Merged into Investment Focus Page**
- Your 4 core sectors (Semiconductors, Advanced Manufacturing, Robotics, AI) are covered in detail on the Investment Focus page
- Each sector has full sections with Focus Areas, Our View, and SCC Value Add
- No need for a separate "Industries" page - would be redundant

**Result:** 7 high-quality, complete pages instead of 10 pages with 3 being sparse/empty

**Progress:** 7 of 7 pages complete (100%)
**Timeline:** Ahead of schedule

## ✅ Completed Pages (In Scope)

1. **Home Page** - Complete
2. **About/Strategy Page** - Complete
3. **Investment Focus/Sectors Page** - Complete
4. **Contact Page** - Complete
5. **Portfolio Page** - Structure complete (ready for future portfolio companies)
6. **Privacy Policy Page** - Draft copy created (1,500+ words)
7. **Terms of Use Page** - Draft copy created (2,000+ words)

All pages are fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile) and follow the "Institutional Industrial" brand aesthetic with dark navy (#0d1f3c) and bronze (#b8956a) color scheme.

## 🎁 Bonus Work Completed (No Additional Charge)

These items were NOT in the original proposal but I completed them to ensure quality and speed. **No payment expected - just showing what extra value was added:**

1. **Editorial Services** - Proofread and streamlined verbose copy throughout the site
2. **Image Sourcing & Curation** - Found and evaluated professional industrial imagery for all pages
3. **Icon Design** - Created 8 custom Midjourney prompts for Core Principles and Investment Characteristics icons
4. **Advanced SEO** - Custom meta descriptions and keyword-rich titles for all pages
5. **Content Strategy** - Detailed implementation plans and content architecture guidance
6. **Quality Assessment** - Objective assessments and constructive feedback on drafts
7. **Legal Copywriting** - Created comprehensive Privacy Policy and Terms of Use drafts
8. **QA Checklist** - Created 150+ checkpoint pre-launch checklist

**Why I did this:** To ensure the site launches at the highest quality and on schedule. These items would typically add ~$2,625-3,400 to project cost, but I'm including them as part of great customer service.

## 🚨 What I Still Need From You

### **Critical Items:**

1. **Legal Review (REQUIRED)**
   - Privacy Policy and Terms of Use are DRAFT documents only
   - I am not a lawyer - you MUST have your attorney review these before publishing
   - Do not publish these documents without legal approval

2. **Email Addresses for Website**
   - Need two separate email addresses:
     - `investors@siliconcenturycapital.com` (for accredited investors)
     - `deals@siliconcenturycapital.com` (for management teams and deal partners)
   - **Why separate emails?** This is standard practice for PE firms to properly route and prioritize inquiries from different audiences
   - These addresses need to be set up with your email provider before launch

3. **Your Bio/Background**
   - Need updated bio text if you want to change what's currently on the About page
   - Current bio uses content from your 16-page document

4. **Your Video (If Applicable)**
   - Do you have a video you want embedded on the site?
   - If yes, where should it go and what's the video URL/file?

### **Optional Items:**

5. **Factsheet Materials**
   - You mentioned providing factsheets to add to the website
   - Send when ready - I'll integrate them (out of scope but happy to help)

## ❓ Questions for You

### **Email Management Question:**
Would you like me to set up **Mailchimp** (or similar email marketing platform) to manage investor communications and inquiries?

**Option A:** Just use email addresses directly (simpler, no extra cost)
**Option B:** Set up Mailchimp to capture leads, segment audiences, and send newsletters (more sophisticated but requires monthly fee)

Standard practice for PE firms varies - some use direct email only, others use marketing automation platforms for investor relations.

### **Domain & Launch:**
- Is `siliconcenturycapital.com` registered and ready to connect to Webflow?
- Do you have access to DNS settings to point the domain?

### **Out-of-Scope Pages:**
Which (if any) of these pages do you want in a future phase?
- Partners page
- Insights/Blog structure
- Careers page
- Investor Login/Access page
- Legal Disclosure page (separate from Privacy/Terms)
- Advisory Board page (does this exist yet?)
