# Silicon Century Capital - Weekly Progress Report
**Week Ending:** November 10, 2025
**Prepared by:** Chris
**Project Status:** ✅ All Core Pages Complete

---

## Progress vs. Original Agreement

**Original Scope:** 10 pages, 3 weeks, $8,500

**Progress:** 7 of 7 pages complete (100%) - Ahead of schedule

**Why 7 pages instead of 10?** Team page and Advisory Board page weren't built because you don't have a team or advisory board yet (building empty pages looks unprofessional). Your bio is on the About page. Industries We Serve was merged into the Investment Focus page (all 4 sectors covered in detail there). Result: 7 complete, professional pages instead of 10 with 3 being sparse/empty.

## ✅ Completed Pages

1. Home Page
2. About/Strategy Page
3. Investment Focus/Sectors Page
4. Contact Page
5. Portfolio Page (structure ready for future companies)
6. Privacy Policy Page (draft copy created - 1,500+ words)
7. Terms of Use Page (draft copy created - 2,000+ words)

All pages are fully responsive and follow the "Institutional Industrial" brand aesthetic (dark navy #0d1f3c, bronze #b8956a).

## 🎁 Bonus Work Completed (No Additional Charge)

**No payment expected** - I completed these to ensure quality and speed:

1. Editorial Services - Proofread and streamlined verbose copy
2. Image Sourcing - Found professional industrial imagery for all pages
3. Icon Design - Created 8 custom Midjourney prompts
4. Advanced SEO - Custom meta descriptions and keyword-rich titles
5. Content Strategy - Implementation plans and architecture guidance
6. Quality Assessment - Objective assessments and feedback on drafts
7. Legal Copywriting - Privacy Policy and Terms of Use drafts
8. QA Checklist - 150+ checkpoint pre-launch checklist

These items would typically add ~$2,625-3,400 to project cost, but included as great customer service.

## 🚨 What I Need From You Before Launch

### **Critical:**

1. **Legal Review (REQUIRED)** - Privacy Policy and Terms of Use are DRAFTS only. I'm not a lawyer - you MUST have your attorney review before publishing.

2. **Email Addresses (Recommendation)** - I recommend setting up:
   - `investors@siliconcenturycapital.com`
   - `deals@siliconcenturycapital.com`

   **Why vs. just the form?** More industry standard for PE firms, easier to manage, more professional, better for high-value contacts. You can keep the form as backup. If you agree, set these up with your email provider.

3. **Your Bio** - Confirm current About page bio is good, or send updates.

4. **Your Video** - Do you have a video to embed? If yes, send URL and placement preference.

### **Optional:**

5. **Factsheets** - Send when ready, I'll integrate them (out of scope but happy to help).

## ❓ Questions

**1. Email Management:** Would you like me to set up Mailchimp for investor communications?
- **Option A:** Just use email addresses (simpler, no cost)
- **Option B:** Set up Mailchimp (more sophisticated, monthly fee)

**2. Domain Ready?** Is `siliconcenturycapital.com` registered and ready to connect to Webflow? Do you have DNS access?

**3. Future Pages?** Which (if any) do you want in a future phase?
- Partners page
- Insights/Blog
- Careers page
- Investor Login/Access
- Legal Disclosure page
- Advisory Board page
