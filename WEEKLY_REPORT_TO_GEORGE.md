## 📋 Scope Clarification - Pages NOT in Original Proposal

During our review of the original proposal, we identified several pages in George's content that were **not included in the original 10-page scope**. We've removed these from the active todo list and will discuss with you separately:

- ❌ Insights/Blog page structure
- ❌ Careers page
- ❌ Investor Login/Access page
- ❌ Legal Disclosure page (separate from Privacy/Terms)
- ❌ Team page (George's bio already on About page, may not need separate page)

**Original Proposal Scope (7 core pages):**
1. ✅ Home (Complete)

7. ✅ Terms of Use (Complete - copy ready for Webflow)

**Note:** The original proposal listed "Team" and "Advisory Board" as separate pages (totaling 10 pages), but since George is currently the only team member, we've incorporated his bio into the About page instead. This reduced the core scope to 7 essential pages, all of which are now complete.
