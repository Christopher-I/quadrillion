→ **FORESIGHT** - This is the most sophisticated visual match for "Institutional Industrial." The aesthetic is nearly flawless for your vision.

### Both Are Excellent Choices (9/10)

The decision comes down to: **Do you prioritize function (Investor X) or form (Foresight)?**

Honestly, either choice will result in an excellent website for your $400M board proposal.
