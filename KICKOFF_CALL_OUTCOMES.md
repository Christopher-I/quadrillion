## 📊 PROJECT WORKFLOW CONFIRMED

### Process:
1. **George sends content** → Word doc dump
2. **Chris implements** → Builds in Webflow
3. **Weekly staging updates** → George reviews live staging site
4. **George provides feedback** → Via email/Upwork
5. **Chris iterates** → Updates based on feedback
