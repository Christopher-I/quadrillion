## This Is A Guide, Not A Fixed Schedule

Some phases may move faster than expected, others may need more time.

**The timeline adapts based on**:

## Week 4: Backup Plan

- Additional revision rounds
- Domain or technical issues
- Legal review requirements

**Target**: December 2, 2025

## Quick Timeline Comparison

| Milestone | Week 3 Path | Week 4 Path |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Template Selected | End of Week 1 | End of Week 1 |
| Content Integrated | End of Week 2 | Mid Week 3 |
| Final Review | Week 3 Friday | Week 4 Thursday |
| **Launch** | **Nov 25** | **Dec 2** |

---

## What Determines Week 3 vs Week 4?

### **Week 3 Launch** - If these align:
✅ Template selected by Friday Week 1
✅ Content delivered early Week 2
✅ Images/headshots ready Week 2
✅ 1-2 revision rounds (not multiple)
✅ No domain complications
✅ Fast decision-making throughout

### **Week 4 Launch** - If any of these occur:
⏰ Design direction needs more time
⏰ Content arrives mid-Week 2
⏰ Images delayed to Week 3
⏰ More than 2 revision rounds
⏰ Domain access issues
⏰ Legal review timing

**Both timelines work fine. We'll know by end of Week 2 which path we're on.**
