**Today**: Saturday, November 2, 2025
**Kickoff Call**: Tuesday, November 5, 2025
**Available Time**: 8hrs Sat + 8hrs Sun + 2hrs Mon = 18 hours total

## WHY THIS WEEKEND MATTERS

**Deep research now = Fast execution later**

Getting the template direction right on Tuesday means:
- Week 2 implementation flows smoothly
- No major pivots mid-project
- George feels confident in the direction
- 3-week timeline becomes achievable

**This is the most critical work of the entire project.**

---

## SATURDAY (8 Hours) - Deep Template Research

### Session 1: Morning (4 hours) - Cast Wide Net

**Goal**: Find 12-15 potential templates

**Process**:
1. **Webflow Template Marketplace** (2 hours)
   - Search terms: "finance", "consulting", "corporate", "B2B", "investment"
   - Filter by: Professional, minimal animation, clean layouts
   - Save anything remotely promising

2. **Webflow Showcase** (1 hour)
   - Look for cloneable sites in finance/consulting
   - Check if any match "Institutional Industrial" vibe
   - Note which are cloneable vs. inspiration only

3. **Premium Template Sites** (1 hour)
   - Flowbase.co
   - Relume library
   - Finsweet templates
   - Any others you know

**Output**: 12-15 candidate templates bookmarked with links

**Break**: 30 min lunch

---

### Session 2: Afternoon (4 hours) - Deep Dive Evaluation

**Goal**: Test drive all 12-15 templates, narrow to 6-8 strong candidates

**For Each Template** (15-20 min per template):

1. **Open Live Preview**
   - Navigate through all sections
   - Test mobile responsiveness
   - Check animation levels (should be minimal for "Institutional Industrial")

2. **Evaluate Against Criteria**:
   - ✅ Does it feel "calm, credible, precise"?
   - ✅ Can it support 10 pages easily?
   - ✅ Is typography hierarchy strong?
   - ✅ Does it work for dual audience (investors + management)?
   - ✅ Can I see George's brand colors working here?
   - ✅ Is customization effort reasonable (70-80% out of box)?

3. **Take Notes**:
   - Screenshot hero section
   - Note what's great about it
   - Note what needs heavy customization
   - Flag any deal-breakers

4. **Score It** (1-10):
   - Visual match: __/10
   - Customization effort: __/10 (10 = easy)
   - Overall fit: __/10

**Output**: 6-8 strong candidates with detailed notes + screenshots

**End of Saturday**: You should have clear frontrunners emerging

---

## SUNDAY (8 Hours) - Deep Evaluation & Presentation Prep

### Session 1: Morning (4 hours) - Test Drive Top 6-8

**Goal**: Really understand each template's strengths/weaknesses

**For Each Template** (30-40 min per template):

1. **Imagine Building SCC Site**:
   - Where would homepage hero go?
   - Where would team section go?
   - Where would investment strategy go?
   - Can I see the dual CTA buttons working?
   - Can I see the semiconductor logo banner fitting?

2. **Check Technical Details**:
   - CMS capabilities (for portfolio companies)
   - Form options (need 2 separate forms)
   - Mobile menu style
   - Page loading speed
   - Browser compatibility notes
   - Any Webflow interactions used

3. **Identify Customization Needs**:
   - What sections need to be rebuilt?
   - What's just color/font swaps?
   - What's layout restructuring?
   - Estimate customization time (1-3 days? 4-5 days?)

4. **Brand Fit Test**:
   - Open brand guide PDF
   - Imagine Deep Navy, Teal, Light Gray in this template
   - Does Quixote + Nanum Gothic work here?
   - Does it match "Institutional Industrial"?

**Output**: Deep understanding of each template's pros/cons

**Break**: 1 hour lunch

## PRESENTATION STRATEGY FOR TUESDAY

### How to Present (Live Demos)

**Opening** (1 min):
"George, I spent the weekend doing deep research on templates. I looked at 15 options and narrowed to these 4 that best fit 'Institutional Industrial.' Let me walk you through each one."

**For Each Template** (5 min):

1. **Show Live** (2 min):
   - Navigate to homepage
   - Scroll through key sections
   - Show mobile view
   - Point out what's strong

2. **Explain Fit** (1 min):
   - "Here's why this could work for SCC..."
   - "It has [X strength] which matches your [Y need]"
   - Show how brand colors would work

3. **Note Customization** (1 min):
   - "This is 70% out of box, would need [X] customization"
   - "Timeline-wise, this is [low/medium/high] risk"

4. **Get Reaction** (1 min):
   - "What's your initial reaction?"
   - "Does this feel right or wrong?"

**After All 4** (5 min):
- "Which 1-2 resonate most?"
- "What do you like/dislike?"
- "Should I show you any alternatives?"

**Goal**: Leave call with 2 finalists, George reviews overnight, Thursday decision call

---

## TEMPLATE SELECTION FRAMEWORK

### Present This to George:

"Here's how to think about choosing:

**If you prioritize SPEED** (3 weeks hard deadline):
→ Pick the template that's most 'out of box'
→ Accept minor compromises for faster launch

**If you prioritize QUALITY** (willing to take Week 4 if needed):
→ Pick the template that needs more customization
→ Get exactly the look you want

**If you want BALANCE**:
→ Pick my recommended template
→ 80% out of box, 20% customization
→ Best shot at Week 3 launch with quality

**My recommendation will be clear, but you decide based on your priorities.**"

## WHAT IF YOU FIND THE PERFECT TEMPLATE EARLY?

**Don't Stop.**

Even if you find an amazing template on Saturday morning:
- Keep researching to find 3 more
- You need options for George to choose from
- Different people see "perfect" differently
- Having 4 strong options = confidence

**The goal isn't finding 1 perfect template.**
**The goal is finding 4 solid options that give George a real choice.**

---

## BACKUP PLAN

### If No Templates Feel Right:

1. **Don't Panic**
2. **Identify Why**: What's not working?
   - Too corporate/stuffy?
   - Too modern/flashy?
   - Wrong layout structure?
   - Animation levels wrong?

3. **Adjust Search**:
   - Look at different categories
   - Check Webflow Showcase for cloneable sites
   - Consider templates from different industries

4. **Have Alternatives Ready**:
   - Keep 2-3 backup templates in your pocket
   - Don't show unless George hates all 4

---

## MINDSET FOR THIS WEEKEND

**Remember**:
- This is the most important work of the project
- "Aligning on direction = 80% of the work"
- Deep research now = smooth execution later
- Your expertise + George's input = right decision
- 18 hours this weekend saves 40+ hours of wrong-direction work

**You've got this.**

The rest is relatively easy once direction is locked.
