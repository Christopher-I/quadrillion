# Key Questions for Tuesday's Kickoff

**Purpose**: Make sure we're aligned on priorities and timeline so we can launch your site ready for the board letter.

---

## 1. WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT FOR LAUNCH?

**Question**: When you send that board letter for the $400M opportunity, which pages do they actually need to see?

- Just a strong homepage?
- Homepage + About + Team?
- All 10 pages fully polished?

**Why it matters**: Helps us focus on what's critical vs. what can be "good enough" and refined later.

**Follow-up**: Are you comfortable launching with a professional "Version 1.0" and adding polish after the board letter goes out?

---

## 2. WHEN CAN YOU PROVIDE CONTENT?

### Critical for Getting Started (Week 1):
- Homepage headline and description
- Company overview (2-3 paragraphs)
- Investment strategy summary

### Needed for Development (Early Week 2):
- Team bios (1 paragraph each)
- Professional headshots
- About page narrative
- Investment criteria details

### Final Content (Mid Week 2):
- Semiconductor company logos
- Advisory board info (if ready)
- Remaining page copy

**Question**: Is this realistic, or do you need more time for any of these?

**Important**: Do you already have this content written, or does it need to be created from scratch?

---

## 3. VISUAL ASSETS - WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

### Team Photos
- Do you have professional headshots for everyone?
- Are they consistent quality/style?
- If not ready: Launch with what you have and update later?

### Company Logos
- How many semiconductor company logos can we use?
- Do any need permission/approval before going public?
- Any legal restrictions we should know about?

### Video Background
- Do you want to select the industrial footage yourself?
- Or should I send you 3-4 options to choose from?
- Backup plan: Launch with high-quality static image, add video later?

---

## 4. LEGAL & COMPLIANCE

**Question**: Do you have legal counsel who should review the investor language before launch?

**What they'd review**:
- Investor inquiry CTA wording
- Disclaimers and privacy policy
- Terms of use

**Timeline**: If yes, when can they review? (Needs to happen by mid-Week 3 for Week 3 launch)

**Alternative**: If no legal review needed, I can use industry-standard compliant language.

---

## 5. TEMPLATE DECISION - SPEED VS. CUSTOMIZATION

**Question**: What's more important to you?

**Option A - Speed (Week 3 launch)**:
- Pick template that's 70-80% ready out of the box
- Customize with your branding (colors, fonts, images)
- Light layout adjustments
- Focus on content quality

**Option B - Quality (likely Week 4)**:
- More significant customization
- Unique sections and layouts
- More distinctive look
- Takes extra time

**Which approach fits your timeline priority better?**

---

## 6. DOMAIN & TECHNICAL BASICS

### Domain
- What domain do you want to use?
- Is it already registered?
- Who has access to the domain settings?

### Email
- Do you have professional email set up (george@siliconcenturycapital.com)?
- Or should I help configure that?
- Where should contact form inquiries go?

**Why it matters**: Domain setup takes 24-48 hours, so we need to start this by Week 3 for a smooth launch.

---

## 7. PAGES THAT MIGHT NOT BE READY

### Advisory Board
- Is this finalized and ready to publish?
- Still forming - skip this page for now?
- Have some members - launch with partial list?

### Portfolio Page
Since you don't have portfolio companies yet:
- Launch with "Coming Soon" placeholder?
- Skip entirely until first acquisition?
- Use past consulting work as examples?

### Insights/Blog
- Want this at launch, or add later?
- If yes: Will you have 2-3 articles ready by Week 3?

---

## 8. YOUR BOARD LETTER DEADLINE

**The most important question**:

**When EXACTLY do you need to send that board letter?**

Target date: __________

**Working backwards**:
- Board letter sends: __________
- Website should be live: __________ (2-3 days before, for safety)
- Everything finalized: __________ (few days before that)

**This helps us plan whether Week 3 (Nov 25) or Week 4 (Dec 2) is the real target.**

---

## 9. REVIEW & DECISION SPEED

**Template Selection**:
When I show you 4 templates on Tuesday, how quickly can you decide?
- My recommendation: Pick your favorite within 24-48 hours
- Your realistic timeline: __________

**Feedback Rounds**:
- How quickly can you review and provide feedback during the project?
- Same day? Within 24 hours? Couple of days?

**Why it matters**: Fast decision-making keeps us on track for Week 3. Slower pace means Week 4 is safer.

---

## 10. SCOPE & FLEXIBILITY

**Question**: We agreed on 10 pages. What if we discover we need 12 pages?

**Example**: Separate pages for each industry (Semiconductors, Robotics, Manufacturing) instead of one combined page?

**Your preference**:
- Stick to 10 pages max - combine content if needed
- Flexible - add pages if it makes sense (we'd discuss)
- Hard limit - defer extra pages to post-launch

---

## TOP 5 QUESTIONS (IF WE'RE SHORT ON TIME)

If we only cover 5 things on Tuesday, these are the critical ones:

1. **What pages MUST be perfect for the board vs. what can be "good enough"?**

2. **When can you deliver team bios, headshots, and page copy?** (Specific dates help)

3. **Do you need legal review of investor language? If yes, when can attorney review?**

4. **What's your actual board letter deadline?** (Work backwards from there)

5. **Template approach: 70-80% out-of-box (faster) or heavy customization (slower)?**
