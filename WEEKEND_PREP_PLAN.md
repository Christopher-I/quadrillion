## TEMPLATE SELECTION STRATEGY

### How to Present Templates to George

**Framework**: "Let me show you 4 directions, from most minimal to most customized"

**Order of Presentation**:

1. **Template A - "The Safe Choice"**
   - Most directly "out of the box"
   - Minimal customization needed
   - Fastest to deploy
   - *"This gets us live fastest with least risk"*

2. **Template B - "The Balanced Option"**
   - Good starting point, moderate customization
   - Strong bones, needs branding work
   - Best balance of quality and speed
   - *"This is my recommendation - Goldilocks option"*

3. **Template C - "The Premium Option"**
   - More sophisticated design
   - Requires more customization
   - Highest quality end result
   - *"This is if you want the best look, can take extra 2-3 days"*

4. **Template D - "The Alternative"**
   - Different aesthetic direction
   - Good if others don't resonate
   - Fallback option
   - *"Just in case the others don't click"*

---

### Decision Framework for George

**Present This Framework**:

"George, here's how to think about this decision:

**If your priority is**:
- **Speed** (3 weeks hard deadline) → Template A or B
- **Quality** (willing to go to Week 4) → Template C
- **Balance** (best of both) → Template B (my recommendation)

**Questions to ask yourself**:
1. Which aesthetic feels most 'Institutional Industrial' to you?
2. Which would make you proud to send to that board of directors?
3. Which matches the semiconductor/robotics/manufacturing vibe?
4. Can you see your brand colors working in this template?"

---

### Getting to Decision by Thu/Fri

**Tuesday Kickoff**:
- Show all 4 templates
- Get initial reaction
- Narrow to 2 favorites
- Give George comparison doc to review

**Wednesday (Day After)**:
- George reviews on his own time
- Sends questions/feedback
- You answer clarifications

**Thursday**:
- Quick 15-min call: "Which one?"
- George makes final decision
- You purchase template immediately

**Friday** (if needed):
- Buffer day in case he needs more time
- You can start brand asset prep meanwhile

**Goal**: Template purchased by end of Friday at latest

---

## WHAT COULD GO WRONG & MITIGATIONS

### Scenario: "None of these templates feel right"

**Mitigation**:
- Have 2-3 backup templates researched (don't present unless needed)
- Ask: "What specifically doesn't work? The layout? The animation? The style?"
- Show backups based on his feedback
- Worst case: Extend search by 2-3 days, adjust timeline

---

### Scenario: "I can't decide between two"

**Mitigation**:
- Ask: "Which one makes you feel more confident sending to that board?"
- Show how brand colors would look in each (quick mockup)
- Recommend one based on timeline/customization effort
- Offer: "We can start with X, and if it's not working after 2 days, pivot to Y"

---

### Scenario: "I need to show this to someone else first"

**Mitigation**:
- Ask: "Who needs to approve, and when can they review?"
- Set clear deadline: "We need decision by Friday to stay on timeline"
- Offer to join that review meeting if helpful
- Adjust timeline if needed

---

### Scenario: "Can we customize this template heavily?"

**Mitigation**:
- Be honest about timeline impact: "Heavy customization adds 3-5 days"
- Explain trade-offs: "We can customize, but might push to Week 4"
- Offer: "Let's launch with 80% out-of-box, then customize in v1.1?"
- Prioritize what customizations matter most

## WEEKEND WORK ESTIMATE

**Saturday**: 6-8 hours
**Sunday**: 6-8 hours
**Monday**: 4-6 hours

**Total**: 16-22 hours of prep work

**Output**: Walk into Tuesday kickoff fully prepared, make efficient use of George's time, get to decision faster

---

## ALTERNATIVE: LIGHTER WEEKEND PREP

If you don't want to spend full weekends on this:

**Saturday (4 hours)**:
- Find 4 solid template candidates
- Take screenshots
- Basic pros/cons

**Monday (3 hours)**:
- Refine comparison
- Prepare kickoff agenda
- Quick review of templates

**Tuesday**:
- Show templates during kickoff
- Get feedback
- Find 2 more options if needed based on feedback

**Thursday**:
- Final decision

This lighter approach still works, just slightly less polished presentation.

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION

**Do the full weekend prep** for these reasons:

1. **Professionalism**: Shows George you're thorough and prepared
2. **Efficiency**: His time is valuable - maximize the kickoff call
3. **Confidence**: You'll feel more confident presenting if you've tested each template
4. **Speed**: Faster decision = earlier launch = less timeline risk
5. **Quality**: Better templates curated = better end result

**The 16-22 hours of weekend work saves 3-5 days in Week 1**, which gives buffer for Week 3.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review this weekend plan** - adjust if needed
2. **Block time on your calendar** for Saturday/Sunday/Monday
3. **Start template research** - begin building that list of 8-10 candidates
4. **Update George** (optional): "I'm prepping templates to show you Tuesday to speed things up"

**Ready to start template research, or do you want to adjust this plan first?**
