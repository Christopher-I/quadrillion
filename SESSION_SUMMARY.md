## What We Accomplished

**Result:** All 7 core pages now complete (100%)

### **2. Documents Created:**

1. **PRIVACY_POLICY_COPY.md** - Comprehensive PE firm Privacy Policy draft
   - 1,500+ words covering SEC compliance, data security, user rights
   - Includes prominent legal disclaimer at top
   - Ready to paste into Webflow after attorney review

2. **TERMS_OF_USE_COPY.md** - Comprehensive PE firm Terms of Use draft
   - 2,000+ words covering securities law compliance, investor requirements
   - Critical "No offer to sell securities" disclaimer
   - Includes prominent legal disclaimer at top
   - Ready to paste into Webflow after attorney review

3. **FINAL_QA_CHECKLIST.md** - Pre-launch quality assurance checklist

   - Clear "What I Need From You" section
   - Questions and next steps

### **3. Key Decisions Made:**

**Page Count Clarification:**
- Original proposal: 10 pages
- Actual delivery: 7 pages
- **Why:** Team page, Advisory Board page, and Industries page consolidated/merged because George doesn't have a team or advisory board yet, and industries are covered in Investment Focus page
- **Result:** 7 complete professional pages better than 10 with 3 sparse/empty

**Email Strategy:**
- Recommended two separate email addresses: investors@ and deals@
- **Why:** Industry standard for PE firms, easier to manage than just forms, more professional
- Positioned as recommendation, not requirement
- Explained it's easier to manage than the form-only approach George suggested

**Legal Documents:**
- Created comprehensive drafts of Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
- Added prominent disclaimers: "I am not a lawyer - these are DRAFTS only"
- Required George to have attorney review before publishing
- Protected both parties legally

**Mailchimp Question:**
- Asked if George wants Mailchimp setup for investor communications
- Option A: Just email addresses (simpler, no cost)
- Option B: Mailchimp setup (more sophisticated, monthly fee)
- Left decision to George
